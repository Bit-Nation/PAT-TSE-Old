# PAT ERC20 Compatible Token

The Pangea Software is a Decentralized Opt-In Jurisdiction where Citizens can conduct peer-to-peer arbitration and create their own Sovereign Nations. Pangea is built with the decentralized Secure Scuttlebot (SSB) and Interplanetary File System (IPFS) technologies, forming a quantum resistant mesh network. Pangea is blockchain agnostic, using primarily the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains.

The Pangea Arbitration Token (PAT) is an ERC20 Compatible in-app token for the Pangea Jurisdiction. The PAT token is proof-of-reputation for Citizens, issued when they create a contract, successfully complete a contract or resolve a dispute attached to a contract. Thus, PAT is an algorithmic reputation token; an arbitration currency based on performance, not based on purchasing power, popularity, or attention. 

The distribution mechanism for the PAT token is an autonomous agent, Lucy, which will initially launch on Ethereum as a smart contract. This mechanism will be blockchain agnostic and can be ported to any viable smart contract platform. An oracle chosen by Bitnation will help to facilitate this (semi) autonomous distribution mechanism in a decentralized and secure fashion.
